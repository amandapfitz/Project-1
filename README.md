# Project-1
 
Created a home search tool that pulls homes for the user based on their preferences. The home preferences are weighted based on the rank of importance designated by the user. Preferences include price, lot size, square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and build year. Once the user inputs their preferences, our code pulls an ordered list of matching homes from Zillow and builds an Excel file with information on the homes for easy viewing and printing.
